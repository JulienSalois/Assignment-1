Student A made changes to style.css
Student A then pushed their changes to github
Student B then pulled from github
Student B made their changes to style.css
Student B then Pushed to github
Student A then pulled the recent changed from github
We did not receive a conflict whoever if student A and B
both pushed their changes there would then be a conflict.
To resolve this conflict user B would have to pull the most recent changes
and then push their recent changes which student A would follow by pulling in
order to have both repos up-to-date.

#1.**We started by fixing our individual issue, then one at a time(to avoid any conflict the other person pull) pushed our solutions to the repo. Once both solutions were revolved and we verified so,we decided to indivually run the command git commit -m "closes #2(3)" to close the issue through bash.**
##2.** We did not get an error message while merging.**
###3.**One at a time, we both closed our issues with git commit -m "closes #1" and then git push. Since there was no conflict in our work we did not get an error.**
